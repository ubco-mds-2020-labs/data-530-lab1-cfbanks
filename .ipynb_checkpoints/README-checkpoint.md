## Feedback on this Lab

**How many hours did you spend on this lab?** 7.0 hours.

**Comments**: What did you learn in this lab? I learned that there are a lot of programs needed for data science. I also learned that if a program does not install properly, sometimes you just need to uninstall it and redownload it, and it will work the 2nd time. I also learned the very basics of git hub. I learned how to push a commit to github. I also got a refresher on the basics of the terminal and terminal commands (I have not used those in a long time). I learned that I will be very busy this year :)
